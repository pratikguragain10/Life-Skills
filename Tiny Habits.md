## Question 4 (1% Better Every Day)

### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

- The most interesting story from this video was about how Dave Brailsford was hired by British Cycling. Before he was hired, British Cycling were at a poor performance stage. 
  After his hiring, Dave Brailsford started the philosophy of 1% improvement in whatever you do. After that, they started their training and practices. 
  They would observe how the riders were training and adjust the sessions appropriately for the cyclists. 
  Not only training, they added something extra like massages and other small behaviours for their personal and body improvement and health. 
  After all these small improvements, from being mediocre, British Cycling improved, and this strategy of Dave flourished into 4 major accolades in 5 years.
