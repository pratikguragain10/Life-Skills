# Good Practices for Software Development

---

### Question 1: Which points were new to you?

Based on the software development practices outlined, several points were particularly insightful:

#### 1. **Formal Documentation Beyond Code Comments**
The emphasis on writing down requirements and sharing them with the team, even when not using tools like Trello or Jira, was a valuable reminder. Many developers focus on code documentation but neglect process documentation, which can lead to miscommunication and scope creep.

#### 2. **The Strategic Use of Group Channels Over Private DMs**
The advice to use group chat/channels for most communications rather than private DMs was eye-opening. The reasoning that "there are more eyes on the main channel" ensures transparency and collective knowledge sharing, which is crucial for team alignment.

#### 3. **Structured Question-Asked Frameworks**
The detailed guidance on how to ask questions effectively - explaining the problem clearly, mentioning tried solutions, using screenshots/diagrams, and leveraging tools like GitHub gists and sandbox environments - provides a professional framework that many developers lack.

#### 4. **Attention Management as a Skill**
The concept that "preserving attention is a skill that you can get better with time" and the recommendation to block social media sites during work hours using tools like TimeLimit or Freedom, reframes productivity as something that can be actively managed rather than relying on willpower alone.

#### 5. **Real-Time Communication Responsiveness**
The advice to "be available when someone replies to your message" and prioritize real-time conversations over hourly back-and-forth exchanges demonstrates a strategic approach to communication efficiency.

### Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

#### **Primary Area for Improvement: Deep Work and Attention Management**

**Current Challenges:**
- Frequent interruptions from notifications and the tendency to multitask
- Difficulty in maintaining sustained focus during complex problem-solving tasks
- Inconsistent work schedule that affects concentration levels

**Ideas for Progress:**

##### 1. **Implement Structured Deep Work Sessions**
- **Time Blocking**: Allocate specific 2-3 hour blocks for focused work with no meetings or interruptions
- **Environment Optimization**: Create a dedicated workspace with minimal distractions
- **Notification Management**: Use "Do Not Disturb" modes during deep work sessions

##### 2. **Technology-Assisted Focus Management**
- **Website Blockers**: Install and configure tools like Freedom, Cold Turkey, or browser extensions to block social media and distracting websites during work hours
- **Phone Management**: Keep phone in another room or use app limiters during work sessions
- **Time Tracking**: Use apps like RescueTime or Boosted to monitor and analyze focus patterns

##### 3. **Physical and Mental Optimization**
- **Regular Exercise**: Implement a consistent exercise routine to improve overall energy and concentration levels
- **Nutrition Management**: Plan meals to avoid energy crashes and maintain steady glucose levels
- **Sleep Hygiene**: Establish consistent sleep and wake times to optimize cognitive function

##### 4. **Communication Efficiency Improvements**
- **Batched Communication**: Consolidate questions and messages to team members rather than sending multiple fragmented messages
- **Scheduled Availability**: Set specific times for real-time communication to avoid constant context switching
- **Documentation Enhancement**: Improve the quality and frequency of written documentation to reduce clarification meetings

##### 5. **Progress Tracking and Adaptation**
- **Weekly Reviews**: Assess what worked and what didn't in terms of focus and productivity
- **Gradual Implementation**: Start with one or two changes at a time rather than overhauling everything simultaneously
- **Team Communication**: Share these improvement goals with teammates to gain their support and understanding

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Improved code quality through sustained focus
- Better estimation of development time
- Reduced stress from constant interruptions
- Enhanced reputation as a reliable and focused team member
- Greater job satisfaction from feeling more productive and in control

**Measurement Metrics:**
- Number of uninterrupted work sessions per week
- Time spent on deep work activities
- Reduction in context-switching incidents
- Quality and quantity of completed deliverables
- Personal satisfaction and energy levels throughout the day
